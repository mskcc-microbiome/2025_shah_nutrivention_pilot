# Example Summary of Data:


These documents are formatted more as html documents, embedding images from the various analysis notebooks. Where possible I liked to reference the dated versions of figures so that they don't accidentally get overwritten in the future. 

<details>
<summary> Look here - an example image embedded in a dropdown! :)  </summary>
<br>
<br>
<img src="../analyses/figures/png/dated_versions/2025-02-05_example_figure.png" width="60%" style="margin-left:15%"/>
<br>

Then add text to explain the figures etc. 

</details>
